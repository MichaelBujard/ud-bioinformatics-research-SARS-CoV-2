# ud-bioinformatics-research-SARS-CoV-2
Computational biology research of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics.

University of Dallas, Irving, TX	
Spring 2021
This repository contains code and other related materials.
A summary of the code is, primarily, a SARS-CoV-2 Phylogenetic Classification Model for Computational Biology Research.
Other programs do other functions, such as select random subset of NCBI data sets.

Advisors: Dr. Robert Hochberg and Dr. Inimary Toby

Description: Build a computational model to classify viral strains of SARS-CoV-2. Implement phylogenetic pattern recognition to map sequence data types to biological systems. Co-design solutions and diagnostics for research in biomarkers. Collaborate and participate in research with a community of machine learning engineers and other researchers. Assist the research community to publish, present, and distribute teachable resources based on the research.
